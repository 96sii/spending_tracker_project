# Spending Tracker 

## Description: 
This spending tracker allows you to add transactions with custom merchants and categories. The amounts are totalled and displayed. 

You can view all spending for particular merchants or spending categories.

You can also set a budget and the spending tracker will display a 'budget bar' giving a visual representation of how much money you have left to spend of your budget. 

The budget bar is programmed to change to orange when you are below 20% of your budget and red when you are below 10%.
